# Frontend Mentor - Blog preview card solution

This is my solution to the [Blog preview card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blog-preview-card-ckPaj01IcS). Itâ€™s a great exercise for practicing HTML & CSS fundamentals, including responsive layout and hover states.

## My process

### Built with

* Semantic HTML5 markup
* CSS custom properties
* Flexbox
* Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this challenge, I reinforced my understanding of:

* **Flexbox** for alignment
* **Box shadows and borders** for card-style UIs
* **Responsive sizing** using `max-width` and `width: 90%`
* **Hover effects** for better interactivity

Here's a snippet that controls the hover state on the title:

```css
.card-title:hover {
  color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
  cursor: pointer;
}
```
