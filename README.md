## My Process

### Built With

* Semantic HTML5
* CSS custom properties
* Flexbox
* Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

This project reinforced my understanding of:

* Using `flexbox` for layout and alignment
* Styling card components with `box-shadow`, `border-radius`, and `borders`
* Managing responsive sizing using `width: 90%` and `max-width`
* Enhancing interactivity using hover states

#### Example CSS snippet:

```css
.card-title:hover {
  color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

### Continued Development

In the future, I’d like to:

* Add transitions to hover states for smoother interactions
* Use a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS for scalable styling
* Explore theming and light/dark mode toggling

### Useful Resources
